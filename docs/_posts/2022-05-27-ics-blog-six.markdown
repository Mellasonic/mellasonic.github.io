The second draft is proceeding smoothly. The game is functioning and many of the assets correlate with each other to create a lively background. So far, many of the assets have been added and there’s more to go. The plan from here on is to continue on this pace, creating level one and three and their functions.

In terms of coding, there has been no significant problem, though communicating the code throughout the group has been difficult, the comments and friendly group explanation help clarify any concerns or problems. Hopefully, in the future, we plan to expand the code more evenly spread out among group members.

Next week, we hope to create the second level and finish the groundwork for the game. After that, we’ll proceed to polish it further.
