Before we hand the initial final project, the last items we need to code are the beginning splash screen and ending screen. A problem we had in creating these was that the graphics were not working as intended as the code was disorganized. We solved this by double checking the code and finding the minor problems causing the glitches.

We also had some problems with the java versions as we had to run it in java eight. We solved this by creating a jar file and making sure the source code runs there and changing the code if needed.

Another problem we encountered was with the sizes of the assets and how we will use them. We changed some of the asset’s sizes to make the game more visually pleasing and made it more obvious on which assets to click on. We did the same with cursor, making it stand out more on the screen.
