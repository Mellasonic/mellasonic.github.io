The main focus today was put on writing the program that switched between levels or backgrounds and also adding assets to create the first level. The first level is a room with a couch in the center with other decorations surrounding it, such as a drawer and picture frames. Most of this was created in pixel art. It’s planned that we have several of these levels, so it's a priority that we can switch between them.

Obstacles for this code include organization, since there are many assets for many levels, therefore the classes and code has to be thoroughly commented and organized to be easily understood by all members. Also, the assets still take a long time to design and create.

When we finish this code, much of the utility of the game will be finished. Future goals include making the entire game runnable.
