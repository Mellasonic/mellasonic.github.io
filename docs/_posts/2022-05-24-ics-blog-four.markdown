As it was the start of a new week, a new plan had to be created. The roles remained similar and we outlined further progress in all our categories. The main system has already been coded, therefore adding more levels should be easier, though the other work remains more or less constant.

One of our group members, Daniel, is absent due to CCO, therefore his workload is less this week. We planned for this absence since the beginning, so it should not affect our productivity and our ability to meet deadlines.

Overall, there’s much more work to be done, though we believe it’s manageable.
