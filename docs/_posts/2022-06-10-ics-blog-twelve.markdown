Before we hand the initial final project, the last items we need to code are the beginning splash screen and ending screen. A problem we had in creating these was that the graphics were not working as intended as the code was disorganized. We solved this by double checking the code and finding the minor problems causing the glitches. 
	We also had some problems with the java versions as we had to run it in java eight. We solved this by creating a jar file and making sure the source code runs there and changing the code if needed. 
	Another problem we encountered was with the sizes of the assets and how we will use them. We changed some of the assetâ€™s sizes to make the game more visually pleasing and made it more obvious on which assets to click on.
	Before submitting, we passed the game for other groups to playtest. It went smoothly, but we received minor feedback for gameplay purposes. First, we changed the game layout as it did not overlay on the game. Second, we added our logo to the game to meet requirements. Third, we made items to be clicked more clearly by adding sparkles on what needs to be clicked. Other minor fixes include errors with cursor, arrows, and titles which did not display as intended. 
	Overall, the game is finished, but we plan on taking the extra four days after submitting to polish the game, code, and comments.
