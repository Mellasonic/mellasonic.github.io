Today, much of the time was spent on communicating the code with groupmates, deciding on graphics, features, and comments. By explaining code to each other, everyone gained a further understanding of the code. Group members that didn’t understand the code much as others were caught up and started helping with the code, writing new code together. We hope by doing this, we cover for each other’s mistakes and allow for a more optimized project.

Level three has been mostly completed, with more specific assets and background. Most of the gameplay has been finished and now we plan to make the gameplay more educational over the next couple weeks.

To further this goal, we are doing more research on food addiction, especially within teens. We will use this information in the game to educate the player.
