The game is functionally complete right now, all the levels and graphics and requirements working as expected. From now, we only have to improve it, adding more details, more research and making it more clear.

A problem we had today was converting the code into a jar file as we have many folders and complications. We had to search online to find out how to make the conversion smooth. After around an hour of brainstorming and working together, we made progress to making it. We also asked questions through email on whether or not this was necessary and learnt that it was for a bonus mark, which we plan on getting.

Future plans include adding more detail to the food and reviewing the requirements on google classroom more thoroughly.
