More graphics were created today for the numerous levels and interactions needed in the game. To create these graphics efficiently was a struggle and it may occupy much of our time in the future. Also, we proofread the code and add more minor comments to ensure everything was working as intended.

The struggle of graphics boils down to how time consuming they are to make, however there are many strategies we use to circumvent this issue. For example, some graphics are copy pasted from each other, though to retain uniqueness, features such as colors and details are changed so players would not be able to recognize the similarities. This saves a lot of time, not needing to make original graphics for everything, while also retaining the visual effect. Another strategy we plan to use is finding graphics online and mimincing them for superior streamlining and efficiency.

Through these processes, we plan to optimize the creation of the game, while also keeping quality.
