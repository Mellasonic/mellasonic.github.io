When first brainstorming topics for this project, several ideas were suggested, such as depression, anxiety, and racism, but the societal problem chosen was addiction. Later, it was specified to be food addiction. We expanded on this every further, outlining a game where a cat has to fight its food addiction to catnip in three levels. As a group, we continued smoothing out details, deciding the layout of the levels and the goals behind them. We also split the workload in roles and created a long term plan.

The largest challenge in the brainstorming period was communicating the technical aspects and the details. It was difficult to envision what the game was going to do and especially how we were going to do it. It was necessary to stay within the bounds of java and the criteria, while also developing a strong idea and game. To do this, we improved and discussed ideas between us, until we found some that worked, such as the topic of the game, food addiction, the levels of the game, level one being a duplicate of level three, and the sprite work, using external programs. 

Future struggles could include implementing the graphics into java and evenly spreading the workload.
