We received feedback on our gameâ€™s storyboard and research pages. It consisted of many useful tips, such as displaying food in the storyboard and clarifying age-specific research in food addiction. Another more general tip was to make everything clearer as the storyboard and research may be considered barebones and could use more depth. We will use this feedback to improve the game in the future.

We will draw food in detail in the game, as this is a game about food addiction. This will allow the player to envision themselves playing the game and also help themes of food addiction. The gameplay itself will be clearer as more detailed text blocks have been planned.

The research will also be improved upon, focusing on young adults. For the game, the most useful research would be that of short two-three sentences of facts, because that compliments the game the best.
