This week will be spent completing the game. First, the third level has been completed with most functionality available. We plan on adding an exit scene and a leaderboard, redesigning the main menu to do so. We also added some animation and more research into the game to polish it further.

We also created the main functions of level two, making cards appearing on the screen, though without graphics.

Problems in creating the code include the leaderboard, which has not been working as we like it too, but discussing it with the group, the problem was soon solved.
