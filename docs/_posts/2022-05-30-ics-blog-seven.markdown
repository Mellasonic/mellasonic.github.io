Over the next week, we plan to finalize the first and second level. The second level is unique, with different backgrounds from the first and third with different gameplay mechanics. Part of the second level includes more information upon food addiction and a more exact point and click system.

This will probably be the last significant code needed for the game. After this, most of the goals will consist of polishing previous code and adding minor features like opening drawers and doors. The assets too, will be mostly finished, with only small items like notebooks and food to be added.

A problem for further weeks could be time management, since this week consists of a day without wifi, an interview, and a field trip. We will work at home more to counterbalance this.
