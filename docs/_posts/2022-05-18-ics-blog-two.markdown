The main menu and assets were created over the last few days in the first work sessions of the project. The assets were made externally, using pixel art from the free version of Libresprite and the main menu was also made in an external program, Intellij. The main issues behind these were importing these individual parts into the game and more specifically jgrasp, which works especially differently from Intellij and was missing key features.

The main menu required several different classes and javafx to help with the graphics. In the main menu, there are three options, a play button, an instruction button, and an exit button. With javafx, a point and click system was developed, which is not only useful for the main menu, but also for the rest of the game, as it is designed as a point and click game.

Some of the assets were created with pixel art, similar to our logo. It mostly consisted of simple basic shades and without shaders. Libresprite allowed just for extra functionality, such as zooming in and out while keeping the pixel art integrity and brush tools and importability. The sprite work is tedious, but substantial progress has been made.
